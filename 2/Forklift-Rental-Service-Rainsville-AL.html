Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane. Often considered to be in a class of their own are aerial lifts , which give a single operator the ability to boom himself up to a hard-to-reach area in a man basket.‚Äù This category includes a wide variety of personnel lifts, including boom lifts and scissor lifts.</p>
