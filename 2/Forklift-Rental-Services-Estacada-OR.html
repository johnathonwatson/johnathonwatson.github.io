Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world. Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.</p>

<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged.</p>

To enable easy movement, the trucked equipped with 200 mm diameter, UHMW-PE steer wheels and UHMW-PE load rollers.
