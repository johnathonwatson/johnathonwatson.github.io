A person must learn how to drive a forklift while carrying a payload.</p>
<p>13 Low lift trucks may be operated by a person seated on the machine, or by a person walking alongside, depending on the design.

They offer straight forward operation and have dual forks at the front of the truck to lift and transport loads.</p>
