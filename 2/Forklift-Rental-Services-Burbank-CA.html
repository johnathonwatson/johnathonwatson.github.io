<p>Some reach trucks come with a tilt mechanism in the cab to help the driver gain a better view of the operation. FORKS: Horizontal tine-line projections, normally suspended from the carriage, for engaging and supporting loads. Designed for terrain that pneumatic tire forklifts can't handle.

<p>Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts. Push the handle down to pump up the pallet jack, then let the handle come back using the mechanical spring.
