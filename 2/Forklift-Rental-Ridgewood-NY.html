<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. Renting provides economical and practical solutions to reflect the changing needs of your business and helps you better adjust to any aberrations in your daily routine. Note: In order to receive your C4 Forklift Operation Certification, you must take and pass a performance evaluation given by your employer at your job site. All-terrain and off-road tires in very large sizes can be crucial for conquering particularly difficult and hazardous trails.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
