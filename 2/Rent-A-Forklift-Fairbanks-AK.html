<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

Within minutes, you can place an order and have a fleet of forklifts on the way. These types of forklifts are ideal for just about every kind of work inside warehouses and distribution centers.</p>
<p>Unlike most other companies in the equipment rental space, Herc Rentals offers a number of tools along with their tractors and forklifts. Our hand pallet truck steering wheels in Nylon and PU are available in the markets with the customization facilities to cater to the ever changing needs of clients. You can get a lifted truck at home with a lift kit, have it done professionally, or buy a truck that is already lifted.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about lifted trucks but, simply put, they're not for everyone. Twin tube, monotube, and reservoir models are all available for anything you're taking on. For advanced off-roading rigs, we have you covered with shocks fitted for lifted suspensions as well as lift kits for DIY upgrades. Please note there will be an additional LO Licence processing fee payable to WorkSafe upon successful completion of your forklift training course.</p>

With the largest rental fleet in Alabama and Northwest Florida, Thompson Lift Truck has what it takes to keep your business moving.</p>
<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world. Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.</p>
<p>United Rentals is an Authorized Dealer for Motorola and can provide a variety of handheld and portable radio solutions. These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications. However, for a warehouse with narrow aisles, having a maneuverable forklift capable of reaching in excess of ten meters makes the reach truck a considerable adversary in the right conditions.</p>
