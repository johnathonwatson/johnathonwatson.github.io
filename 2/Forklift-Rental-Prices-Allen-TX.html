<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks have a cab that tilts so that the operator can have a better view of the fork carriage, while others actually have small cameras attached to the carriage.

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
