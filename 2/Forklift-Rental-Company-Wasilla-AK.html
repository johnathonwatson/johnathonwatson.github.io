<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift. A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck.</p>

Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>

These options are available on flexible, competitive priced monthly payment plans ensuring that each unique customer can structure a payment plan suitable to their budgetary needs and forklift fleet requirements.</p>

You can find Counterbalance Forklift Truck Driver jobs in Knowsley Industrial Park, Kirkby Ind Est, Kirkby Industrial Estate and Kirkby (L32).

Three-wheeled counterbalance forklifts are mainly used in warehouses and loading docks where there isn't much room for maneuvering or turning.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
