<h2>Used Pallet Jack Louisville</h2>
<p>These Class 4 forklifts are one of the most commonly used forklifts in the U.S., typically used indoors for applications such as manufacturing, warehousing, bottling, and trucking. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilizes a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>

Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use.

We will focus on how to maintain your forklift's stability and handling, as well as how to lift loads properly.</p>
