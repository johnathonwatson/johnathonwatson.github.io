<h2>Types Of Material Handling Equipment Erlanger </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
