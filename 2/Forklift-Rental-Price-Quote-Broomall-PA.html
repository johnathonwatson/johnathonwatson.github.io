<p>Keep your credit line clear - Unlike financing equipment, long-term rentals have little impact on your ability to borrow money to increase your business. Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>But it's basically a powered industrial truck which is used to lift and transport materials in businesses, most commonly goods that are stacked on pallets. Our rental fleet has over 900 rentals ready for use at short notice. With these batteries, you benefit from our 2Shifts1Charge guarantee, which is unrivalled in the logistics sector: Our electric counterbalance trucks can complete two consecutive shifts without the need for battery replacement or top-up charging.</p>
<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you want to make sure it has enough power to do the job. While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory. On a powered pallet truck, however, the lifting of the load, and truck movement, is powered by the electric motor within the machine.</p>

<p>Simply put, a pallet jack is a large tool used to lift and move heavy pallets.

We provide the best Warranty in the business and can offer outstanding Lease & Finance packages.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
