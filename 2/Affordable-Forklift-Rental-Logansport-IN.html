After learning about each of these appliances and their uses, it is essential to sit down and reflect. This training is for workers who operate an industrial lift truck (classes 1, 4 or 5) in the workplace, commonly known as counterbalance forklift”.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
