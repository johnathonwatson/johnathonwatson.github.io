Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

<p>We are currently looking for LO licenced stockpickers who are looking for on-going work in TRUGANINA and FOOTSCARY. A large suv or more often truck that has had longer suspension components nailed on it to increase ground clearance. Instead, body kits are primarily used just for style enhancements. Forklifts built in countries like Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.</p>
<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods.

<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
