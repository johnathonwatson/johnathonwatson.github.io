<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. But as a general rule, most forklifts can take a multitude of different sizes and configurations. Rarely will you find a lifted truck that still has the stock tires on it. Larger off road tires are not designed to maximize road performance. Pneumatic Forklifts : Use: Primarily used outdoors, can be used indoors if space allows. The Yale electric order pickers offer quiet, effortless operation and an abundance of features, all focused on ensuring operators can achieve faster, more accurate, order picking no matter the order picker.</p>

With the largest rental fleet in Alabama and Northwest Florida, Thompson Lift Truck has what it takes to keep your business moving.</p>

With rated load capacities commonly ranging between 5,500 lbs and 12,000 lbs, popular models include power shift transmission and all-wheel steering as well as a number of additional steering features that allow the operator to position the lift as close to the work area as possible.</p>

Raymond® Type E and EE trucks are designed and manufactured to operate in classified locations as defined in NFPA 505.</p>

The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
