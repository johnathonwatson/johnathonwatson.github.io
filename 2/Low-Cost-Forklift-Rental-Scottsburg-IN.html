<h2>Pallet Truck Parts Scottsburg</h2>
<p>It's called a counterbalance forklift because the load that's being carried in the front is counterbalanced by a heavy weight mounted on the back of the vehicle. Sit-down Forklift and Rider Pallet Jack experience is helpful. Workplace type and conditions are also factors in hazards commonly associated with powered industrial trucks.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
