When renting forklifts these points will help ensure your rental experience is safe, cost effective, and gets the job done.</p>
<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor.
