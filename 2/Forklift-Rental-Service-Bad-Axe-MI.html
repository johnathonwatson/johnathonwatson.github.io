<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies. Should you operate forklift trucks you will be aware that all drivers need to be properly trained and certified. We're here to answer your questions and to finally put to rest which is better, a lifted truck or a lowered truck. Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

If you drive a forklift on an incline, you must keep the load on the uphill side. Flexibility is perhaps the greatest benefit to renting a forklift versus buying. We have new and used forklifts for sale and as rentals.</p>

Many of our long-term customers had their first exposure to the fuel efficiency, high productivity and ease of operation of Linde forklifts through their dealings with our forklift hire department.

Crown also introduced a number of technology enhancements to improve forklift safety. At ProMat 2019 in booth #S3603, attendees can view the brand-new Yale® robotic reach truck, an industry-first dual-mode pantograph robotic lift truck capable of autonomously depositing and retrieving loads from locations as high as 30 feet and reaching into double-deep storage.</p>

Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>
