Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other.

<p>United Rentals is an Authorized Dealer for Motorola and can provide a variety of handheld and portable radio solutions. These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications.
