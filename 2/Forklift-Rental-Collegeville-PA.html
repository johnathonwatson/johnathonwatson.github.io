<h2>Fork Truck Companies Collegeville</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>Driving with the load downhill can result in loss of the load and control of the forklift. Efficient, versatile and productive, Raymond Counterbalanced Lift Trucks perform at the highest levels.

<p>The maximum weight, expressed in pounds, of a load with a stated horizontal and vertical distance to the center of gravity of the load that a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable also on 406 of this Standard, can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer. But with that freedom comes some drawbacks that need to be addressed in order for a lifted truck to work reliably and effectively as a daily driver.</p>
