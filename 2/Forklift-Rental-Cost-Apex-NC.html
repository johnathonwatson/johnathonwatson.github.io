<p>RT forklift manufacturers—and there are more than you might think, some with surprisingly broad product lines—are pursuing ongoing refinement of their machines. Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>
<p>The shape and thickness of the handle along with the design and placement of the control lever minimize operator fatigue and improves productivity. Forklifts are one of the most expensive pieces of machinery on a jobsite. These pallet trucks are designed to carry heavy loads with minimum effort. SIDE LOADER: A self-loading truck, generally high-lift, having load engaging means mounted in such a manner that it can be extended laterally under control to permit a load to be picked up and deposited in the extended position and transported in the retracted position (Fig.</p>

<p>Training centres offer the opportunity for the unemployed with little or no forklift operating experience to achieve a certificate of competence and increase their employment opportunities.

<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
