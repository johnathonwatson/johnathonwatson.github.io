Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>

<p>We bring forth our vast industrial experience and expertise in this business, instrumental in providing Forklift Truck.

With no mast blocking the view ahead like on conventional forklifts, the Teletruk's unique side boom provides unrivalled forward visibility.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work.
