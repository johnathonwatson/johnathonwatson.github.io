<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely.

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
