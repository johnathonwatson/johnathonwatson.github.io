<p>For loads exceeding 2500kg, a motorized pallet jack, "walkie stacker" or Forklift is recommended. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore.

<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over.
