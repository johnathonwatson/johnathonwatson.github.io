<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.

<h3>4 Fork Forklift Drexel Hill PA</h3>
<p>With over 500 machines in stock at any time we are a leading independent supplier of used forklifts for the UK, Europe and Asia. Our sales consultants also use the information to determine how many units you require or what combination of units will be best for your operational requirements. Whether rented or owned, these forklifts save time, labor, and money; their appeal is undeniable.</p>
<p>Based on region, the global pallet truck market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America. That's very good for an electric forklift. These changes can actually improve the handling of a pickup, however, and there is no limit, beyond a practical one, to how much lift this kind of kit can give a truck. Whether you have seasonal business, a temporary increase in workload, or are taking on a special project with a definite endpoint, leasing a forklift is probably the way to go. And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
<p>This type of forklift makes use of pneumatic or air-filled tires, as opposed to counterbalance forklifts which use cushion tires. Control pedals and control platforms stood on or engaged by the operator's feet should have non-skid surfaces. The lift truck industry experienced a host of new equipment innovations over the past year. At Penske Chevrolet, we pride ourselves on being your lifted truck dealership in the Cerritos and Long Beach area.</p>
