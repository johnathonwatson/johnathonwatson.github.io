<p>Available in both manual and electric operated versions, pallet trucks come in different variants to suit desired applications. The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift.

<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.

<p>A suspension lift kit will truly give you that monster truck feeling, as they can be raised as high as practically possible. Even with a solid 4% job growth for forklift operators expected between 2018 and 2028 , robotic forklifts are set to take over. Most rough-terrain forklift models have gasoline- or diesel-powered engines, but some models run on propane. Forks that are meant to carry the load are attached to the main body of the forklift by a pair of roller chain pulleys whose fulcrum forms a gear at the top of the mast.</p>
