<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6‚Äù suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable.

<p>They offer numerous models that can suit any materials handling job. Order pickers work best in warehouses that operate for library archival storage, retail applications and furniture picking. Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks.

<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both.

Manufacturing Areas: While rough terrain forklifts aren't designed for indoor use, you can put them to work in enclosed spaces.</p>
<p>If your warehouse is stocked full of pallets, a warehouse forklift is an efficient way to carefully load and remove balanced inventory from industrial shelving. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
