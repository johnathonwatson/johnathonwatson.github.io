<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>161 Rule: Vehicles will not be driven in and out of trucks trailers at unloading docks until trucks are securely blocked and brakes set. The safest place for a forklift operator to be during an accident is strapped into the seat with their seatbelt fastened. Renting a forklift helps you stay on budget. See all our counterbalance and reach forklift trucks. Whether you know that lifted trucks are your thing or you are still looking at all of your choices and trying to make a decision, we are here to help.</p>
<h2>Buying A Used Forklift Wise </h2>

Ahern specializes in high reach equipment, which permits the safe lifting of people or materials to work at height.</p>
<p>Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>
<p>Front flotation tyres generate an outstanding stability of loads on forks to transport heavy weight. Improved tech and advanced builds make these forklifts very safe. We are the leading manufacturer of Hb-series High Lift Pallet Trucks and our product is made of good quality. Remember that the price of the equipment isn't the only cost you'll incur if you purchase a forklift.</p>

A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
<p>The 30 Wastemaster counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>
