<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. These types of forklifts can accelerate and travel at higher speeds, which also makes them ideal for outdoor uses. More elaborate lift kits not only raise the body of your truck up but can also increase the clearance of your truck's frame and let you put bigger tires on your pickup. Take a closer look at the most important features to find out how rough terrain forklifts get the job done.</p>
<p>Popular types are high-lift fork truck, high-lift ram truck, high-lift boom truck, high-lift clamp truck, and high-lift platform truck (Fig. ATTACHMENT: A device other than conventional forks or load backrest extension, mounted permanently or removably on the elevating mechanism of a truck for handling the load.

Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>

<p>Report pallet jacks with a failing hydraulic unit. Our guide covers the most popular forklift types and the best uses for each, so you can make a well-informed, confident decision on which is the best forklift for your specific warehouse and its needs.
