Rough terrain forklifts have the build and rugged construction to handle tough outdoor work. Due to their variety in fueling, size and either a four or three wheel design, counterbalance forklifts are arguably the more versatile of the two trucks.</p>

<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.
