Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks. In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.</p>
