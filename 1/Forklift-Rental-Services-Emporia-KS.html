<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>
