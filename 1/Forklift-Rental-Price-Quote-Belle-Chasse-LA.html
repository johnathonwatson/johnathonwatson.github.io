Forklifts are commonly used in warehousing, storeroom, supply chain, and distribution environments. If you are a Private Individual looking to obtain a CPCS card for a Rough Terrain Forklift, the implications are very different from those of a CITB registered construction company.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend.

<h2>Pallet Jack Parts Belle Chasse</h2>
<p>Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options.
