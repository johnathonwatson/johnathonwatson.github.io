<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal of at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable.

<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking.
