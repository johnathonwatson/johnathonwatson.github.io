<p>Easily movable sidegates allow operators to open the case-picking window, helping them to be more productive. Battery and charger included with rentals.

<p>31. 31 Training Program Content (continued)  The requirements of the OSHA standard on powered industrial trucks must also be included in the initial operator training program.
