<h2>Lift Truck Safety Marion</h2>
<p>Often, this is not as easy to accomplish with the transmission or transfer case side of the driveshaft, and your U-joint-style driveshaft is best tossed for a custom unit, using a double cardan or CV joint that can run smoothly at higher angles. Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.
