<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us. Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels. The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>
