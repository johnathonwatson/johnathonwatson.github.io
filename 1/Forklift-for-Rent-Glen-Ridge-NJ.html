<h2>Narrow Aisle Lift Truck Glen Ridge</h2>

This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Toyota's industrial vehicle and equipment business started in March 1956 with lift truck production and sales in Japan.
