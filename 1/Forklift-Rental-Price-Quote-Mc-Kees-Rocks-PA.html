A telehandler forklift is also known as a telescopic forklift or a reach forklift. IC forklifts are a different class of forklift from the previous ones, as these models are often better suited for outdoor use. FMI provides an exclusive analysis of Global Pallet Trucks Market”. If you plan on going for the former, make sure you are aware of how much you have to spend on suspension lift kits.</p>
