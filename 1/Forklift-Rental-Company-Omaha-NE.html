You will benefit from our over forty years in the industry and will quickly see why your organization's material handling needs are best met through Granite Industrial Trucks.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift. Its optimized design and quiet, stable mast allows for precise control of loads of all shapes and sizes, especially when used with a variety of attachments. OSHA tests you on properly driving forklifts. Product-line features: Each of the JCB rough-terrain forklifts is powered by a four-cylinder diesel engine generating 76 horsepower, driven for quick, smooth operation in all terrain by a JCB SyncroShuttle transmission.</p>
<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials.

<p>Moving Materials: With a rough terrain forklift, moving materials around a job site is easy. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity. Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks also present a danger to those driving in them. The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required.

As rental rates can be assessed differently, spelling out the time period can save you money by getting reduced long-term rates or reducing the term of your rental to the tightest possible time period.</p>
