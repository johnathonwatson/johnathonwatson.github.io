<p>We provide high quality counterbalance forklift, reach forklift truck, pallet truck, stacker dedicated to your business. The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane. Often considered to be in a class of their own are aerial lifts , which give a single operator the ability to boom himself up to a hard-to-reach area in a man basket.” This category includes a wide variety of personnel lifts, including boom lifts and scissor lifts.</p>

The Rental Department of Raymond Storage Concepts strives to provide quality equipment and solutions to your short and long-term rental needs. The answer is similar to electric forklifts above.

I can have anywhere from 20 to 30 attendees representing 15 different companies (in the industrial, manufacturing, and construction fields) with each company using several types of forklifts.
