<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies. Should you operate forklift trucks you will be aware that all drivers need to be properly trained and certified. We're here to answer your questions and to finally put to rest which is better, a lifted truck or a lowered truck. Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>

The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required.

<p>Standards Notice: SN 66 allows the use of a spring-loaded brake system or dock lock in lieu of chocking, as a means that secures trucks or trailers to loading docks. Built for the extreme, the WT Series platform pallet truck features a cast-steel reinforced chassis, up to 12 mm thick covers, die-cast aluminum handle and the toughest side restraints available.</p>
<p>This safety switch (which can be a pedal or other special safety harness) will prevent the the lift truck from moving unless activated by the operator. It is important to be aware of the potential hazards of order picker trucks. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
