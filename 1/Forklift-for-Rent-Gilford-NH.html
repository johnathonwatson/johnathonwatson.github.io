<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

<p>A warehouse forklift can also carry weight that your human warehouse staff simply can't. Commonly found on port loading docks, scrap yards and recycling plants, and within an endless variety of other industrial applications, there is one consistency among every rough terrain forklift: versatility. Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>A lift kit can have a serious impact on your off-road driving. Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months. A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000.
