To achieve worker safety, Raymond developed the Raymond virtual reality (VR) simulator , a supplemental educational tool that helps new and experienced operators learn and practice forklift operating skills on an actual truck in a secure, warehouse environment. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks come with a tilt mechanism in the cab to help the driver gain a better view of the operation. FORKS: Horizontal tine-line projections, normally suspended from the carriage, for engaging and supporting loads. Designed for terrain that pneumatic tire forklifts can't handle. Best for: Toyota's electric order picker is ideal for many types of operations and industries including: warehouse order picking, and Third Party Logistics (3PL) companies with square footage over 10,000 square feet.</p>
